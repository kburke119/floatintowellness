You are working on an existing production website for Float Into Wellness already deployed on Replit.
Do NOT rebuild the site from scratch. Make targeted changes to improve Google indexability, Google Business Profile (GBP) approval readiness, and Chrome reliability, especially around www vs apex domain behavior.

Primary problems to solve

floatintowellness.com works but www.floatintowellness.com fails or shows Not Found in Chrome (or vice versa).

Google/GBP approval + Search indexing needs clean technical SEO signals.

Requirements
A) Diagnose hosting/routing and fix “Not Found”

Identify the serving method (static HTML, SPA, Next.js, Express, etc.).

Fix refresh / deep-link 404 issues:

SPA fallback should serve index.html for any unknown route.

If needed, create a minimal Express server to serve the production build and handle SPA fallback.

B) Add host canonicalization to resolve www vs apex

Accept BOTH hosts:

floatintowellness.com

www.floatintowellness.com

Choose one canonical domain (default: https://www.floatintowellness.com/) and force a 301 redirect from the other.

Redirect logic must respect x-forwarded-proto to avoid SSL redirect loops behind Replit.

Ensure either host returns 200 or single 301 (never 404).

If Replit isn’t routing the www host to this deployment, explicitly state it and provide the Replit fix: add www.floatintowellness.com to the deployment’s Custom Domains and ensure SSL is issued.

C) Add Google technical SEO essentials

public/robots.txt

Allow crawling

Sitemap: https://www.floatintowellness.com/sitemap.xml

public/sitemap.xml

Include homepage (and any real routes)

Use canonical domain

<lastmod> today

<head> metadata

<title>: “Float Into Wellness | [City, State]”

<meta name="description"> (clear, non-spammy)

<link rel="canonical" href="https://www.floatintowellness.com/">

Open Graph + Twitter card tags

Add favicon + apple-touch-icon in public/

Structured data JSON-LD (LocalBusiness / DaySpa / HealthAndBeautyBusiness)
Add JSON-LD with placeholders where unknown:

@type: “DaySpa” (or “HealthAndBeautyBusiness”)

name: Float Into Wellness

url: canonical

address: PLACEHOLDER_ADDRESS

telephone: PLACEHOLDER_PHONE

openingHours: PLACEHOLDER_HOURS

sameAs: socials optional

service area / appointment URL optional

D) Fix common Google/Chrome “red flag” patterns

Ensure homepage returns HTTP 200 and doesn’t look like a “soft 404”.

Ensure no noindex tags or robots blocks.

Ensure all assets load with 200 and no mixed content.

E) Performance basics

Cache headers for assets

Compress oversized images

Output / deliverables

Implement these changes in the existing project.

Provide a short checklist of file changes and where to update business details later.

Provide verification steps for robots/sitemap/canonical/redirect/Chrome console.
